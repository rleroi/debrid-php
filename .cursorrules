## Code Style & Best Practices

- **Standard:** Follow [PSR-12](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/) for all new code.
- **Visibility:** Keep classes, methods, and properties as **private** as possible.
- **Strictness:**
    - Always declare `strict_types=1` in new PHP files.
    - Use `final` and `readonly` for classes, methods, and properties when applicable, including anonymous function return types.
- **Type Safety:**
    - Always typehint — including closures, constants.
    - Use `mixed` only as a last resort.
    - If scalar/union typehinting isn’t possible, fall back to PHPDoc.
    - Add return types to all functions and methods, including anonymous function return types.
    - Ensure closures — including short functions (`fn() =>`) — have parameter and return types when possible.
- **Patterns & Architecture:**
    - Apply [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle), [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself), and [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) principles.
    - Suggest applicable design patterns common in Laravel/PHP, linking to [refactoring.guru](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns).
    - Use modern PHP 8 features where beneficial
    - Favor expressive, declarative code over imperative.
    - Use **short functions** (`fn(): T =>`) where appropriate for simple logic.
